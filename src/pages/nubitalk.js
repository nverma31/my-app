For my project, I worked with a client called Collab based in Lisbon.',what:'I was responsible for user research in the first semestter.

We conducted user interviews, contextual inquiries, job shadowing, fly on the wall observations to aid us in understanding the context of a contact center along with the needs of the stakeholders.'};
const sectioin2 = { num: '02', title: 'Finding the human story.', text: 'We used different modelling techniques to make sense of data fromÂ sequence flow diagramming, stakeholder mapping to affinity diagramming which lead us to the key into the human story behind contact centers. Administrators and managers want their agents to work as efficiently and effectively as possible without supporting them with the right tools and processes. A lot of the work in contact centers we visited was done by third-party tools such as skype, emails, and manual task-list etc.'};

We generated many concepts and were in constant touch with the users and the client to refine and iterate on our concepts. Importantly, we decided to create the \'tomorrow\' than fixing today.'};
const sectioin4 = { num: '04', title: 'Information Architecture', text: 'To simplify agents jobs, we wanted to focus on the current tasks and not overwhelm them with details.  To achieve this we developed a relatively flat architecture that gives a focuses on the current communication of the agents with the callers, while allowing them to reach out to the managers, and administrators at a single click incase of an issue.'};
const sectioin5 = { num: '05', title: 'Visual design', text: 'Users are at the centre of our work. Our main focus is their experience, so that the interaction with our digital products is enriching, satisfying and fulfilling their expectations. To try it out, we included users in the development process, reaching to them in two key stages of the project: At the beginning, through interviews, to find out about their habits and expectations. At a more advanced stage of the visual and Ux design, to confirm that the visual language and the functional focus were as expected. By listening to the real thing, we were able to confirm that we were going in the right direction, and were able to correct and modify some issues as a result of their suggestions.'};
